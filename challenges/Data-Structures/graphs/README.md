# Graph
consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.


## Challenge
Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
- AddNode()
- AddEdge()
- GetNodes()
- GetNeighbors()
- Size()



## Approach & Efficiency

using ES6 classes, definning a class for Vertex, a class for edges, and a class for the graph which uses JS Map()
