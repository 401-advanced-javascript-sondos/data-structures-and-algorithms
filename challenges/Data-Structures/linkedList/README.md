# Singly Linked List
A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

## Challenge
to make singley link list and insert,include,to string function in it.

<br><br>


## Approach & Efficiency
 I use while loop to go over all nodes to change the time for searching ,
 Also use the classes and constructor .

 * big O :
    * insert : space O(1) , time O(1)
    * includes : space O(n) , time O(1)
    * to string : space O(n) , time O(1)
<br><br>

## API   
* insert method : takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance. 
* includes method : takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
* toString method : takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: "{ a } -> { b } -> NULL" .
