Implement a Queue using two Stacks. Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement a standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods: enqueue() and dequeue(). The Stack instances within the PseudoQueue will have the push(), pop(), and peek() methods, and will be instantiated within the PseudoQueue constructor.

Implement the following methods:

 - enqueue(value): Takes in argument value and inserts it into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

 - dequeue: Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.


## Big O Time:
enqueue() & dequeue(): O(1)

## Big O Space:
enqueue() & dequeue(): O(1)
