## Stack and a Queue Implementation
-Stacks and Queues are both commonly used data structures that allow us to dynamically store and retrieve data items in two very different ways.
- A stack is a dynamic data set in which elements use the Last-In-First-Out principle (LIFO) to define data structure.
- Stack structure limits data in the way that it can only be added to or removed from the top.
- Queues are implemented using a First-In-Fist-Out (FIFO) principle, meaning that the items are removed from the list in exactly the same order in which they were added to it.
- Queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

## Challenge
- create class for stack with methods push(), pop(), isEmpty(), peek().
- create class for Queue with methods enqueue (), dequeue (), isEmpty(), peek().

## Approach & Efficiency
- use classes and node implentation for stack and queue.
* big O :
  * stack:
    - push : space O(n) , time O(1),------> This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.
    - pop : space O(n) ,time O(1) ------> This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.
    - isEmptey :space O(n) ,time O(1) ------> This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.
    -peek():space O(n) ,time O(1) ------> This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.
 * Queue:
    - Dequeue  : space O(n) , time O(1),------> This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.
    - enqueue : space O(n) ,time O(1) ------> This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.
    - isEmptey :space O(n) ,time O(1) ------> This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.
    -peek():space O(n) ,time O(1) ------> This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.
