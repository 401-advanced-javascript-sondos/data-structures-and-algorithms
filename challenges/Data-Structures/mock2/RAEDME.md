## Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of nodes which reads the same backward as forward.


## Challenge
make a function to check if the list is palindrome or not.


## Approach & Efficiency
 I use while loop to go over all list and push it to array ,  then iterate over the array .

* big O :
    * loop : space O(n) , time O(1),------> This is because the  loop has a complexity O(n) and it is run n times.
