## Tree
A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.


## Challenge
- Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows: If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz” ,If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz” ,If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”.

## Approach & Efficiency
* creat fuzzbuzz function.
* use classes tree 
* big O :
   - O(n) : because we loop over the whole tree.
