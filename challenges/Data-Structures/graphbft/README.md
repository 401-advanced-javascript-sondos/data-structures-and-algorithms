# Graph
consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.


## Challenge
* Extend your graph object with a breadth-first traversal method that accepts a starting node. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in the order they were visited. Display the collection.


## Approach & Efficiency

using ES6 classes, definning a class for Vertex, a class for edges, and a class for the graph which uses JS Map()
