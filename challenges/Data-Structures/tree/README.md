## Tree
A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.


## Challenge
- create Node class with value and right and left.
- create Tree class methods preorder (), inorder (), postorder(), add(), contains().

## Approach & Efficiency
- use classes and node implentation for tree and BST.
* big O :
   - O(n) : because we searching about place of node and worst case to be last node.
