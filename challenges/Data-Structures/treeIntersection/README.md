## Tree
A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.


## Challenge
- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
- use classes and node implentation for tree .
* big O :
   - O(n) : because we searching about place of node and worst case to be last node.
